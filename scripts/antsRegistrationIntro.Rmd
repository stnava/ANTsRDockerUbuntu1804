We first load the library and example images.

```{r chunk1}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=12, fig.height=8)
library( ANTsR )
library( pander )
r16 = antsImageRead( getANTsRData( "r16" ) )
r64 = antsImageRead( getANTsRData( "r64" ) )
```


As always, it is important to look at the data.

```{r chunk2}
plot( r16 )
plot( r64 )
plot( r16, r64, color.overlay='magma', doCropping = F, window.overlay = quantile( r64, c(0.72,1) ) )
```

We are concerned about how similar images are *in physical space*.

Why?

* resolution can be different but content "the same"

* patient may be the same but in different position

* image orientation can vary

* need to compute physical regularization and transformation parameters

* we ultimately want to label images and do consistent statistical computations

* i.e. "computational anatomy" or metric-based brain mapping

We need a way to measure this - so let us write some quick similarity metrics.

```{r msq}
# msq fuction
msq <-function( x, y ) {
  mean( ( x - y )^2 )
}
```

```{r corr}
# corr fuction
icor <-function( x, y ) {
  # will not work unless images are in same space
  cor.test( as.numeric(x), as.numeric(y) )$est
}
```

```{r ncc}
# ncc fuction
# ... too tricky for now but can be implemented by using getNeighborhoodInMask and apply functions or for loops
```

Let us translate these images to get them in the same space (up to translation).

```{r chunk3}
treg = antsRegistration( r16, r64, typeofTransform = 'Translation' )
plot( r16, treg$warpedmov, color.overlay='jet', doCropping = F, alpha=0.5,
      window.overlay = quantile( r64, c(0.72,1) ) )
```

How about a similarity transform?

```{r chunk4}
sreg = antsRegistration( r16, r64, typeofTransform = 'Similarity', verbose=F )
plot( r16, sreg$warpedmov, color.overlay='jet', doCropping = F, alpha=0.5,
      window.overlay = quantile( r64, c(0.72,1) ) )
```


Or an affine transformation?  Note - verbosity is on here.  We can look at the output and peek under the hood a bit.

```{r chunk5}
areg = antsRegistration( r16, r64, typeofTransform = 'Affine', verbose=T  )
plot( r16, areg$warpedmov, color.overlay='jet', doCropping = F, alpha=0.5,
      window.overlay = quantile( r64, c(0.72,1) ) )
```


The image subtraction highlights differences perhaps a bit easier.

```{r chunk6}
asub = r16 / mean( r16 ) - areg$warpedmov / mean( areg$warpedmov )
plot( asub )
plot( r16, abs(asub), color.overlay='jet', doCropping = T, alpha=0.8,
      window.overlay = c(0.5,5 ) )
```

Or maybe looking at a canny filter overlay.

```{r chunk7}
mycan = iMath( areg$warpedmov, "Canny", 1, 5, 12 )
plot( r16, mycan, color.overlay='jet', doCropping = T, alpha=0.8,
      window.overlay = c(0.5,5 ) )
```

Of course - this is the whole purpose of similarity metrics.  We use MI here ...

```{r chunk8}
mysimilarity = c(
  antsImageMutualInformation( r16, r64),
  antsImageMutualInformation( r16, treg$warpedmovout),
  antsImageMutualInformation( r16, sreg$warpedmovout),
  antsImageMutualInformation( r16, areg$warpedmovout) )
```

*deformable* registration adds even more value

```{r chunk9}
dreg = antsRegistration( r16, r64, typeofTransform = 'SyN', verbose = F  )
creg = antsRegistration( r16, r64, typeofTransform = 'SyNCC', verbose = F  )
mysimilarity[ 5 ] = antsImageMutualInformation( r16, dreg$warpedmovout)
mysimilarity[ 6 ] = antsImageMutualInformation( r16, creg$warpedmovout)
nparameters = c( 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 )
plot( nparameters, mysimilarity, type='l', main='Similarity vs number of parameters' )
```

did anyone notice how long (compute time) each of these takes?

sidenote:  `export ITK_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_THREADS=4`

we will see later how to get the real number of parameters for the transformation objects above.

clearly, deformable registration does "best."   but does it produce meaningful results?

depends on how you do it:

* [CURT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3274625/)

* [SyN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17659998)

* [ITK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24817849)

SyN / ITK produces differentiable maps with differentiable inverse.

Results from the "SyN" algorithm which uses mutual information as a metric.

```{r chunk10, out.width = '100%'}
gridf = createWarpedGrid( r16, fixedReferenceImage = r16, transform = dreg$fwdtransforms[1] )
gridb = createWarpedGrid( r16, fixedReferenceImage = r16, transform = dreg$invtransforms[2] )
plot( gridf )
plot( gridb )
```

Results from the "SyNCC" algorithm which uses NCC as a metric.

```{r  chunk11,out.width = '100%'}
cgridf = createWarpedGrid( r16, fixedReferenceImage = r16, transform = dreg$fwdtransforms[1] )
cgridb = createWarpedGrid( r16, fixedReferenceImage = r16, transform = dreg$invtransforms[2] )
plot( cgridf )
plot( cgridb )
```

What does "differentiable map with differentiable inverse" mean?  The diffeomorphism is like a
road between the two images - we can go back and forth along it.

```{r  chunk12}
plot( dreg$warpedfixout )
plot( r64 )
```

It also means that if we compose the mapping from A to B with the mapping from B to A, we get the identity.

We can check this by looking at the result of the composition of SyN's forward and inverse maps.


```{r  chunk13}
emptygrid = createWarpedGrid( r16, fixedReferenceImage = r16 )
invidmap = antsApplyTransforms( r16, emptygrid,
   c( dreg$invtransforms, dreg$fwdtransforms ),
   whichtoinvert = c( T,F,F,F ))  # tricky stuff here
plot( invidmap )
```

This "inverse identity" constraint is built into SyN such that
we enforce consistency in the digital domain.

What this means is - any "shape change" is encoded *losslessly* into the deformation field.

Non-diffeomorphic maps may *lose* information or may be completely uninterpretable, statistically.

One way to check this is to investigate the jacobian.  They should be positive which indicates that the topology of the image space is preserved ( no folding and no holes or tears are created ).

```{r  chunk14}
djac = createJacobianDeterminantImage( r16, dreg$fwdtransforms[1], geom = TRUE )
print( range( djac ) )
cjac = createJacobianDeterminantImage( r16, creg$fwdtransforms[1], geom = TRUE )
print( range( cjac ) )
```

Is there a difference between the two jacobians?  Paired t-test.

```{r  chunk15}
mask = getMask( r16 ) %>% morphology("dilate",3)
print( t.test( cjac[ mask == 1 ], djac[ mask == 1], paired=TRUE  ) )
# cjac looks a little "larger" ... but is that the right way to ask this question?
djac = ( createJacobianDeterminantImage( r16, dreg$fwdtransforms[1], geom = TRUE, doLog = T ) )
cjac = ( createJacobianDeterminantImage( r16, creg$fwdtransforms[1], geom = TRUE, doLog = T ) )
print( t.test( cjac[ mask == 1 ], djac[ mask == 1], paired=TRUE  ) )
```

Look at some histograms.

```{r  chunk16,fig.height=4,fig.width=8}
library( ggplot2 )
n = sum( mask == 1)
mydf = data.frame(
  registration = c( rep( "cc", n ) , rep("mi", n ) ),
  jacobian = c( cjac[ mask == 1 ], djac[ mask == 1] ) )
ggplot( mydf, aes(jacobian, fill=registration )) + geom_density(alpha = 0.2)
```

SyN is among the best performing registration methods so this additional information
stored in the jacobian is likely to be valid, assuming that one knows what to do with it.

```{r chunk17}
plot( r16, list( cjac, cjac * (-1) ), doCropping = F, alpha = 0.85,
      color.overlay  = c( 'red', 'blue' ),
      window.overlay = c( 0.2, max( abs( cjac ) ) ) )
```

Look at the canny result using the diffeomorphism.

```{r chunk18}
mycan = iMath( creg$warpedmov, "Canny", 1, 5, 12 )
plot( r16, mycan, color.overlay='jet', doCropping = T, alpha=0.8,
      window.overlay = c(0.5,5 ) )
```

This is a good registration result ... and such results can be gained not only in simple 2D examples but also in many other cases: healthy aging, neurodegerative disorders, TBI, stroke, non-human, non-brain, etc.

It's not wise to just eyeball images as a validation.  Much better to do landmarking or labeling as in [this publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28656622) and [many others](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811908012974).

## How do we use landmarks/labels to evaluate?

Let's just use a trivial example based on left / right hemisphere labels.

```{r leftright}
library( ANTsR )
r16 = antsImageRead( getANTsRData( "r16" ) )
r64 = antsImageRead( getANTsRData( "r64" ) )
# symmetrize the image
symimg <- function( x, gs = 0.25 ) {
  xr = reflectImage( x, axis = 0 )
  xavg = xr * 0.5 + x
  for ( i in 1:5 ) {
    w1 = antsRegistration( xavg, x, typeofTransform = 'SyN' )
    w2 = antsRegistration( xavg, xr, typeofTransform = 'SyN' )
    xavg = w1$warpedmovout * 0.5 + w2$warpedmovout * 0.5
    nada1 = antsApplyTransforms(  x, x, w1$fwdtransforms, compose = w1$fwdtransforms[1] )
    nada2 = antsApplyTransforms(  x, x, w2$fwdtransforms, compose = w2$fwdtransforms[1] )
    wavg = ( antsImageRead( nada1 ) + antsImageRead( nada2 ) ) * ( -0.5 )
    wavgfn = tempfile( fileext='.nii.gz' )
    antsImageWrite( wavg, wavgfn )
    xavg = antsApplyTransforms( x, xavg, wavgfn )
    }
  return( xavg )
  }
r16symm = symimg( r16 )
plot( r16symm )
################################################################
r16lrmask = getMask( r16symm )
r16lrmaskcrop = cropImage( r16lrmask )
r16lrmaskcrop[ 1:round(dim(r16lrmaskcrop)[1]/2), 1:round(dim(r16lrmaskcrop)[2]) ] = 2
r16lrmask = decropImage( r16lrmaskcrop, r16 ) * r16lrmask
plot( r16symm, r16lrmask, alpha=0.5 )
################################################################
r64symm = symimg( r64 )
r64lrmask = getMask( r64symm )
r64lrmaskcrop = cropImage( r64lrmask )
r64lrmaskcrop[ 1:round(dim(r64lrmaskcrop)[1]/2), 1:round(dim(r64lrmaskcrop)[2]) ] = 2
r64lrmask = decropImage( r64lrmaskcrop, r64 ) * r64lrmask
plot( r64symm, r64lrmask, alpha=0.5 )
```

We symmetrized the images and labeled left and right.

In theory, we must transfer the labels back to original space.  But for this example, we can simply compare the overlap of the labels, post-registration.

```{r symmol}
plot( r16symm, r64symm, alpha = 0.5 )
quickreg = antsRegistration( r16symm, r64symm, typeofTransform = 'SyN' )
lr64to16 = antsApplyTransforms( r16symm, r64lrmask, quickreg$fwdtransforms,
                                interpolator = 'genericLabel' )
plot( r16symm, lr64to16, alpha=0.5 )
pander( table( lr64to16[ r16lrmask == 1 ] == r16lrmask[ r16lrmask == 1 ] ) )
pander( table( lr64to16[ r16lrmask == 2 ] == r16lrmask[ r16lrmask == 2 ] ) )
```

We will revisit some of these concepts in more detail later when we discuss template building.

## This seems really easy - doesn't registration have "lots of parameters?"

There are many parameter choices.  We've eliminated some of them via heurisitics:

* automatic parameter scaling for manifold transformations (rigid, affine)
* step sizes are automatically adjusted (for the most part)
* bins in mutual information selected based on experience
* convergence is setup ahead of time
* standard procedures are available that work most of the time
    * cannot rely on these if your problem is not the "most of the time" type

Things one might want to toy with:

* multiresolution strategy
* smoothing strategy
* interaction of smoothing and multi-resolution
    * pyramid vs
    * scalespace
* multiple metrics / different metrics
* different features combined with different metrics
    * curvature images
    * edge images
    * label maps
* transformation models
    * syn
    * bspline syn
    * time varying velocity field
    * gaussian displacement field ( demons style )
* point and image features together
* multiple modality guidance e.g. T1 and T2 or T1 and DTI


**Exercise** Take a look at:

```{r areg}
?antsRegistration
args( antsRegistration )
```

Why or how would we modify the following parameters?

* initialTransform - one may use an initializer (see ?affineInitializer) or some other method to get an initial transform

* outprefix - saves transforms to a file location

* mask - will only use in-mask features to guide the registration

* gradStep - not common to change this but may do so in conjunction with totalSigma adjustments

* flowSigma - this will regularize the similarity metric graident, which we follow to get a good registration .... higher sigma focuses on coarser features

* totalSigma - this will regularize the total deformation field.  usually zero, higher values will restrict the amount of deformation allowed

* affMetric - changes the metric used for rigid/affine stage of registration

* affSampling - used to control the metric parameters, changes the sampling frequency

* synMetric - changes the similarity metric for the deformation stage of registration

* synSampling - used to control the metric parameters, as in affSampling

* regIterations - controls the multi-resolution strategy.  more entries leads to more downsampling.

Also, we might compare to antsRegistration -- the command line C++ version -- which allows even greater flexibility.

We recommend the command line version for "non-standard" use cases and/or multiple similarity metrics to be used in parallel ... ( TODO: implement multimetrics in ANTsR )

## What other metrics are there for registration quality?

* one can compare (across different methods):
    * prediction accuracy for independent data as in [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879923)
    * biological validity of results as in [this effort](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4889433/)
    * assumptions of the similarity metrics, transforms, etc
    * ability to:
        * handle point, curve, surface, volume data
        * merge point and image modality data together
        * implement multivariate similarity measurements
        * compute statistical operations on mappings
        * handle vector, tensor data
* computation time versus accuracy - tradeoff between quality and speed
* statistical bias and performance on multiple site data
* longitudinal smoothness / bias / biological plausibility of deformation maps
* generality vs specificity - this is the 'no free lunch theorem'
* types of transformations that can be captured ( see the aperture problem )
* sparsity versus density of the maps ( e.g. SIFT, HOGG vs  SyN, FFD, Demons/optical flow )
* probably many more options ...
